  I was at lecture1 when I ran `cd` with no arg which took me to the parent folder, then I ran `cd lecture1` which took me to lecture 1. Then I ran `cd hello.java` which gave me an error since the command works for directories and not files.

  I was at lecture1 when I ran `ls` with no argument and it showed me all of the files inside of the lecture1  directory. Next I ran the command `ls messages`. Then the last time I tried it I got an error when attempting to run `ls hello.java` because `ls` does not work for files.

  I was at lecture1/messages when I ran `cat en-us.txt` which gave me the text for that file. Then I ran it again immediately and `cat en-us.txt fr.txt` which concatenated both of the text files and output them to the terminal. The no-arg `cat` and trying to use `cat` on a directory give an error.
